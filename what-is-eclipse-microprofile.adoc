= What is Eclipse MicroProfile

Eclipse MicroProfile is an open source specification for Enterprise Java microservices.  It is a community-driven innovation project whose goal is to work on microservices patterns for Enterprise Java and to integrate applications with the infrastructures they run on, (that is, a cloud environment) with patterns like health checks, metrics, etc. The focus of Eclipse MicroProfile is rapid collaborative innovation and this is why the project has a time-boxed release schedule, with each release including incremental updates or new features, and there is no guarantee of backward compatibility across releases.

The Eclipse MicroProfile community is composed of individuals, vendors, and organizations.

Eclipse MicroProfile is not Java EE or a subset of Java EE. This confusion occurred because the first release of MicroProfile (before it became part of The Eclipse Foundation) was a collection of three Java EE APIs, namely, CDI, JSON-P, and JAX-RS. The MicroProfile community purposely made the first release of MicroProfile small because they wanted the community to decide the best path of evolution for the project. The MicroProfile community took a "no need to reinvent the wheel" approach for the first release and chose three enterprise-grade, market and production-proven APIs from Java EE to get started. In fact, MicroProfile utilizes some existing Java EE APIs and combines them with new APIs to create a platform for Java microservice architectures.

Eclipse MicroProfile 1.1 included Config, which is a MicroProfile sub-project, and Eclipse MicroProfile 1.2 included updates to Config as well as the new MicroProfile sub-projects: JWT Propagation, Metrics, Fault Tolerance, and Health Check. Likewise, Eclipse MicroProfile 1.3 included additional brand new MicroProfile sub-projects: Open API, Open Tracing, and Type-safe Rest Client. As of this writing, MicroProfile 1.4 included updates to Config, JWT Propagation, Fault Tolerance, Open Tracing, and Rest Client. In addition, MicroProfile 2.0 included the latest updates to CDI, JSON-P, JAX-RS and the addition of JSON-B, all from Java EE 8. With these releases, Eclipse MicroProfile will offer the same level of functionality to be usable with either Java EE 7 or Java EE 8. Lastly, Eclipse MicroProfile 2.1 included updates to Open Tracing.
