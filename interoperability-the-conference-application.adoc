= Interoperability - "The Conference Application"

The “Conference Application”, first link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG-XvoIfKtg[presented] during Devoxx Belgium in November 2016, is a MicroProfile demo that showcases the integration of different MicroProfile vendor implementations.  The demo consists of four microservices, each developed by a different vendor implementation of MicroProfile. This link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-conference[demo application] is maintained by the community.

The "Conference Application" mimics an application used by the attendees of a technical conference to:

- See a list of sessions to attend (Session microservice)
- See a list of speakers delivering sessions (Speaker microservice)
- Schedule sessions to attend (Schedule microservice)
- Vote for a session (Vote microservice)

The application also has a web-app component as a front-end user interface that directly subscribes to each of the microservices.
 
Here is a pictorial description of the architecture of the "Conference Application":

The following table summarizes each microservice, its underlying open source implementation, and the vendor that developed the microservice business logic.

In Appendix A of this book, you will find the resources to download, build and run an adapted version of the "Conference Application", in which the microservice-session microservice, developed in the WildFly Swarm implementation of MicroProfile, has been enriched with the MicroProfile JWT Propagation, Health Check, Metrics, and Config APIs.
